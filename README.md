# raylib-kern

`raylib-kern` provides a Kern-shaped wrapper for
[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). The Craft package name is `raylib`, so
applications import it with:

```kern
use raylib;
```

This repository pins raylib 6.0 as a Craft resource and builds the C sources
through Craft instead of requiring a system `libraylib`.

The public API is hand-maintained and organized by raylib domain:

- `raylib`: root prelude for common types, constructors, and color constants.
- `raylib.window`, `raylib.input`, `raylib.drawing`, `raylib.images`,
  `raylib.textures`, `raylib.text`, `raylib.shaders`, `raylib.models`,
  `raylib.audio`, `raylib.files`, and `raylib.automation`: focused modules for
  the complete Kern-facing wrappers in each area.

`src/raw.kn` is generated as the direct C ABI layer. It is package-internal and
only used by the public modules. Resource behavior is exposed on the resource
values themselves: load or generate through the domain module, then call methods
such as `texture.draw_at(...)`, `image.resize(...)`, `sound.play()`, and
`music.update()`.

## Requirements

Craft fetches raylib from Git and compiles the required C modules from the
resource tree. Platform system libraries are still linked by the build script.
On Linux that means OpenGL and X11 development libraries must be present for
examples or applications to link.

On Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel libXi-devel libXcursor-devel
```

## Quick Start

```toml
[dependencies]
raylib = { git = "https://github.com/softfault/raylib-kern.git" }
```

Local development can use a path dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
raylib = { path = "../raylib-kern" }
```

Run the included example after platform development libraries are installed:

```sh
craft run --example basic_window
```

## First Window

```kern
use raylib;

const TITLE = "raylib-kern first window\0";
const MESSAGE = "Hello from Kern + raylib\0";

fn main() i32 {
    let win = raylib.window.open(800, 450, TITLE)
        .target_fps(60);
    defer win.close();

    while (win.is_open()) {
        win.frame()
            .clear(raylib.RAYWHITE)
            .text(MESSAGE, 190, 200, 20, raylib.DARKGRAY)
            .fps(10, 10)
            .end();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Strings

raylib's C API expects zero-terminated `const char *` strings. Recent Kern
versions type string literals as `[]u8` byte slices, so the ergonomic wrapper
functions accept `[]u8` directly. The binding still does not allocate or append
the C terminator for you: pass a literal with `\0` when calling helpers that
cross into raylib.

```kern
const TITLE = "raylib-kern basic window\0";
"Hello from Kern + raylib\0".draw(190, 200, 20, raylib.DARKGRAY);
```

For runtime text that is not already terminated, allocate a temporary C string
with `base.abi.cstr` before passing it to the public wrapper.

## Input

Input helpers are frame-polled, so call them from the update part of the loop.
Use `_down` for continuous behavior, such as moving a sprite while an arrow key
is held. Use `_pressed` for one-frame actions, such as toggling a menu or
changing color on a mouse click.

```kern
var pos = raylib.vector2(400.0, 225.0);

if (raylib.Key.RIGHT.down()) {
    pos.x += 2.0;
}

if (raylib.MouseButton.LEFT.pressed()) {
    pos = raylib.input.mouse_position();
}
```

## Textures

```kern
const LOGO = "resources/raylib_logo.png\0";

let win = raylib.window.open(800, 450, "textures\0")
    .target_fps(60);
defer win.close();

let logo = raylib.textures.load_texture(LOGO)..&;
defer logo.unload();

while (win.is_open()) {
    let frame = win.frame().clear(raylib.RAYWHITE);
    logo.draw_at(raylib.vector2(40.0, 40.0), raylib.WHITE);
    frame.end();
}
```

```kern
let image = raylib.images.load_image(LOGO)..&;
defer image.unload();

image.flip_vertical();
image.draw_text("loaded from an image\0", 8, 8, 18, raylib.BLACK);

let texture = image.to_texture();
defer texture.unload();
```

## Audio

```kern
let audio = raylib.audio.open();
defer audio.close();

let sound = raylib.audio.load_sound("resources/click.wav\0")..&;
defer sound.unload();

sound.set_volume(0.8).play();
```

```kern
let music = raylib.audio.load_music_stream("resources/theme.ogg\0")..&;
defer music.unload();

music.play();
while (music.is_playing()) {
    music.update();
}
```

## Colors

raylib's named colors are exposed as `pub const` values such as
`raylib.RAYWHITE` and `raylib.DARKGRAY`. They rely on Kern's `const`
compile-time semantics and must not lower to linkable global storage.

Color transforms are available as value methods:

```kern
let overlay = raylib.BLUE.alpha(0.5);
let warning = raylib.YELLOW.lerp(raylib.RED, 0.35);
```

## Binding Generation

raylib changes its API regularly. The long-term source of truth for the raw ABI
is raylib's parser output, not a hand-maintained copy of `raylib.h`. Craft builds
and runs the Kern host tool in `tools/raylib-bindgen` against
`tools/rlparser/output/raylib_api.txt` from the pinned raylib resource.

Only `src/raw.kn` is regenerated. The public wrapper modules are hand-maintained
so they can use Kern naming, module boundaries, focused convenience helpers, and
documentation that explains raylib's ownership and frame-loop expectations.

Regenerate the checked-in bindings after updating the pinned raylib resource:

```sh
craft build --project-path tools/raylib-bindgen
tools/raylib-bindgen/.craft/build/dev/target/out/raylib-bindgen-0.1.0/bin/raylib-bindgen raw \
  .craft/resources/raylib-*/raylib/tools/rlparser/output/raylib_api.txt > src/raw.kn
```

## Scope

The generated raw layer targets raylib 6.0's stable C ABI. The public wrapper
covers the representable raylib areas as focused Kern modules. C varargs and
callback ABI shapes are intentionally omitted until Kern has a suitable public
contract for them.
